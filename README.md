# Adversarial Outlier Exposure

</div>
 
This is the repository for the CVPR Workshop Paper: "Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection with Adversarial Outlier Exposure" by Botschen, Kirchheim et al. 

![Showcase of functioning of Adversarial Outlier Exposure on CIFAR-100](example.png)
Synthetic Outliers drawn from a BigGAN trained-on CIFAR-100 with increasingly strong adversarial perturbation targeting the classifier's energy function. Perturbed OOD images do not resemble ID data but tend to have low energy-based outlier scores. 

## Repository Contents
This repository enables the user to do the following things:
- Finetune a pretrained WideResNet with (Adversarial) Outlier Exposure
- Training Data can be augmented by Adversarial Attacks (on ID and OOD)
- As ID we currently support: CIFAR10, CIFAR100
- As training OOD data we use GAN-generated images, which need to be manually created (or downloaded) and added to the `/datasets` folder
- Supported Adversarial Attacks: FGSM, PGD, MI-FGSM, EBA, EPS_GAUSS, None

 ## Folder structure:
 ### Configuration
 
- `config/*`: default experiment configuration (will be overwritten by hydra)

### Modules 
- `eval.py`: evaluation logic
- `training.py`: training logic
- `utils.py`: utility functions
- `attacks.py`: adversarial attack logic

## Installation
We recommend using Anaconda for package management and Python 3.8 for compatibility.

You can install all dependencies with:
> pip install -r requirements.txt


## Synthetic Outliers
It is mandatory to place the GAN generated OOD data from below in the folder ```datasets/```. 
The synthetic outliers used in this work were generated by [this work](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SU7OAfhc8OM). 

These can be downloaded from the link below, where you have to replace `[x.y]` with, e.g., 2.0 to download the dataset generated with a $\sigma = 2.0$:

> https://files.kondas.de/goe-data/samples-[x.y].npz

Sigmas from 0.0, 0.1, ... to 10.0 are supported.
Afterwards, place them in the folder ```datasets/```

## Run the code
The training with default parameters can be run by:

> python3 run.py --config-name NAME_OF_CONFIG

For example: 

> python3 run.py --config-name cifar_adversarial_auroc.yaml

Results get saved in a .xlsx file called `results.xlsx`.
